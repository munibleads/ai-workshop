Design a web productivity application named “ExpenseEasy” with a modern, minimal UI/UX inspired by top-tier apps like Notion and Mint. Create a clean, card-based layout with smooth cards, intuitive icons, and subtle gradients. Prioritize aesthetics with rounded corners, polished animations, and a clutter-free design. Ensure the app is responsive and appeals to budget-conscious individuals and casual users. This will be an MVP, focusing on must-have features only.

UI Goals:
• Combine minimalism with usability for a seamless and premium experience.
• Intuitive navigation with a clean top navbar for easy access.
• High-contrast CTAs for clear user actions and quick interactions.
• Consistent spacing and padding for a polished, professional look.
• Smooth animations for transitions and interactions to enhance user engagement.

Visual Style:
• Color Palette:
  - Background: #F9FAFB (light gray for clean backdrop)
  - CTA Color: #10B981 (emerald green for vibrant actions)
  - Accent Colors: #3B82F6 (blue), #F59E0B (amber)
  - Shadows: rgba(0,0,0,0.05) for subtle depth
• Visual Components:
  - Cards with hover effects and subtle shadows for expense entries
  - Header section with a soft gradient background
  - Inline icons for expense categories (e.g., food, travel)
  - Rounded input fields for adding expenses

App Screens (one-liners):
1. Dashboard/Home – Overview of recent expenses, total spending, and category filters
2. Add Expense – Simple form to input expense details (amount, category, date)
3. Expense List – List view of all expenses with sort and filter options
4. Summary – Basic chart showing spending by category
5. The navigation bar should be at the top, not the side.

Microinteractions / Animations:
• Cards fade in with a slight slide on page load for a dynamic feel.
• Buttons scale slightly (0.2s) on click for tactile feedback.
• Chart bars animate smoothly when loading the summary screen.

Functional Requirements:
• Allow users to create, edit, and delete expense entries.
• Track total spending with a simple summary by category.
• Provide filtering by date or category for expense lists.
• Include a basic bar chart for spending visualization.
• Ensure responsive design for desktop and mobile.
