Design a web fitness tracker application named “FitTrack” with a modern, vibrant UI/UX inspired by top-tier apps like Strava and Fitbit. Create a clean, card-based layout with smooth cards, bold imagery (only men images, no women's images please), and intuitive icons. Prioritize aesthetics with rounded corners, vibrant visuals, and polished animations. Ensure the app is iOS/Android compatible using Expo and appeals to fitness enthusiasts and casual users. This will be an MVP, so develop accordingly.
The web application must have a PWA feature, with a button to the bottom right "Download App".
UI Goals: • Combine vibrant visuals with usability for an engaging experience • Intuitive navigation with a bottom tab bar for quick access • High-contrast CTAs for clear user actions • Consistent spacing and padding for a polished look • Smooth animations for transitions and interactions

Visual Style: • Color Palette: • Background: #F5F7FA (light gray for clean backdrop) • CTA Color: #FF5733 (vibrant orange for energy) • Accent Colors: #4A90E2 (blue), #FFD700 (gold) • Shadows: rgba(0,0,0,0.1) for subtle depth • Visual Components: • Cards with subtle shadows and tap effects • Hero section with gradient background and motivational imagery • Inline icons for workout types and stats • Rounded buttons and input fields for user inputs

App Screens (one-liners):


Dashboard/Home – Overview of daily activity, steps, and workout summary
Workout Screen – Start/track workouts with real-time metrics
Progress Tab – Visual charts for weekly/monthly fitness progress
Profile Screen – User settings and fitness goal customization

Microinteractions / Animations: • Cards fade in with slight upward slide on screen load • Buttons pulse on tap with 0.2s scale effect • Progress bars animate smoothly during data updates

Functional Requirements: • Allow users to log workouts and set fitness goals • Track steps, calories, and workout duration with visual indicators • Provide filtering for workout history by type or date • Include data visualization for progress trends • Support light/dark mode for accessibility • Ensure compatibility with Expo for iOS/Android deployment
