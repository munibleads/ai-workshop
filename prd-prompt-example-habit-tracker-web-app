Design a web-based habit tracking application called “HabitFlow” with a sleek, modern, and premium UI/UX inspired by top-tier productivity apps like Notion, Todoist, and Streaks. Create a clean, minimal, and intuitive layout with smooth cards, vibrant visuals, and polished animations. Prioritize aesthetics with rounded corners, elegant typography, and consistent spacing for a high-end feel that appeals to productivity enthusiasts. Ensure the app is responsive for desktop and mobile browsers.

UI Goals:

Combine minimalism with usability for a premium, distraction-free experience
Clean, card-based layout for habits with subtle shadows and rounded corners
Intuitive navigation with a fixed sidebar or top navbar, and subtle highlights for active states
High-contrast CTAs (e.g., vibrant green “Add Habit” button)
Consistent padding/margins (e.g., 16px–24px) and polished spacing
Smooth animations for adding habits, completing tasks, or navigating sections
Visual Style:

Color Palette:

Microinteractions / Animations:

Habit cards fade in with a slight upward slide on page load
Completion buttons pulse softly (0.2s scale animation) when clicked
Progress rings animate smoothly as habits are marked complete
Sidebar or navbar items highlight with a subtle color transition
Page transitions use a smooth fade or slide effect for a polished feel
